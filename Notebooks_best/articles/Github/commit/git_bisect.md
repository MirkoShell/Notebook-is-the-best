# git bisect

I extracted and enhanced this TIL from [my April 8th 2020 weeknotes](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/8/weeknotes-zeit-now-v2/#git-bisect) to make it easier to find.

I fixed two bugs in Datasette using `git bisect run` - a tool which lets you run an automated binary search against a commit log to find the source of a bug.

Since I was figuring out a new tool, I fired up another GitHub issue self-conversation: in [issue #716](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/716) I document my process of both learning to use `git bisect run` and using it to find a solution to that particular bug.

It worked great, so I used the same trick on [issue #689](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/689) as well.

Watching `git bisect run` churn through 32 revisions in a few seconds and pinpoint the exact moment a bug was introduced is pretty delightful.

The first step is to tell it the range of commits that you want to search in, using `git bisect start`:

```
$ git bisect start main 0.34
Bisecting: 32 revisions left to test after this (roughly 5 steps)
[dc80e779a2e708b2685fc641df99e6aae9ad6f97] Handle scope path if it is a string
```

Then you provide a script that will return an error if the bug is present.

Usually you would use `pytest` or similar for this, but for the bug I was investigating here I wrote this custom script and saved it as `check_templates_considered.py`:

```python
import asyncio
import pathlib
from datasette.app import Datasette
import httpx

async def run_check():
    ds = Datasette([])
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(app=ds.app()) as client:
        response = await client.get("http://localhost/")
        assert 200 == response.status_code
        assert "Templates considered" in response.text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(run_check())
```

This script will fail with an assertion error if `Templates considered` is not included in the HTML for the homepage.

To run the bisection, use `git bisect run <script goes here>`:

```
$ git bisect run python check_templates_considered.py

The final output shows exactly which commit introduced the bug. In this case it was [70b915fb4bc214f9d064179f87671f8a378aa127](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/70b915fb4bc214f9d064179f87671f8a378aa127) (the "first bad commit").
